# Solarized Dark Iterm2 (Fixed)

It seems the preset solarized dark theme of iTerm2 has some values wrong. The
most obvious one is that the background color is a little bit darker than the
original color.

Fixed those colors according to http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized.

No fancy, just import it.
