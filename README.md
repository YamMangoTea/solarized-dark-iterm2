# Solarized Dark Iterm2 (Fixed)

It seems that the preset solarized dark theme of iTerm2 gets some values
wrong. The most obvious one is the background color which is a little bit
darker.

Fix is based on the color table which is found at
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized.

No fancy, just import the XML file.
